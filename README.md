# Projet React JS-MongoDB - Concession Automobile
The aim of this project is to get to grips with a web interface created using an Express JS API and to learn how to manage a mongoDB database.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/GourmelenT/projet-react-JS-MongoDB.git
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/GourmelenT/projet-react-JS-MongoDB.git
git push -u origin main
```
## Before continuing, check that you have installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm]() :
```
node -v
npm --version
```


## Next, we'll install all the necessary dependencies:
```
npm i express
npm i mongoose
npm i -g nodemon
```

## Finally, we'll launch the project in the project with the following command:
```
nodemon server.js
